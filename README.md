## Hey, I'm Sean.
I'm a 25-year-old software engineer with passions for movies and frontend development--but _mainly_ for movies.

### About Me
- 🎬 **"Cinephile"**: I love all kinds of movies. Happy movies, sad movies, good movies, bad movies.
- 💻 **Frontend Developer**: My focus is on creating appealing, intuitive, and accessible user interfaces for interesting projects.
- 🎮 **Guy Who Plays Video Games**: I try not to identify myself as "a gamer." It just never sounds right--maybe it reminds me too much of Gerard Butler's 2009 Sci-Fi Action flick _Gamer_? Who can say.

### My Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Design**: Figma
